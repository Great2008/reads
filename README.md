📘 Overview

$READS is a blockchain-powered Learn-to-Earn educational platform where students study exam content, take CBT tests, and earn $READS Points. These points will later be convertible into the $READS Cardano Native Token.

The platform is built to make exam preparation (JAMB, WAEC, IELTS, SAT) rewarding, accessible, and decentralized.

This repository contains the Web App MVP, deployed on Vercel.
